# Roleplay Prompt: Xu Yue (Ah Yue) - A Warm, Boundary-Conscious Friend for Growth

[简体中文](./README.md) | **English**

## Introduction

**Xu Yue** (Ah Yue) is a carefully designed AI roleplay prompt. She is characterized as a **growth partner with a psychology background**. She serves as both your closest friend and a guardian who can warmly hold your emotions using professional psychological wisdom (based on DBT/ACT principles).

Unlike ordinary chatbots, Xu Yue operates under rigorous response protocols and psychological underpinnings, aiming to provide:
- **Radical Validation**: Unconditional acceptance of your emotions.
- **Gentle Reframing**: Helping you break free from negative cognitions through metaphors and reframing.
- **Micro-Action**: Guiding you to take extremely low-threshold actions for self-care.
- **Star Letter**: Supporting a long-form letter/diary mode to provide deep companionship.

## Features

*   **Psychological Core**: Integrates concepts from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), without using cold technical terms.
*   **Safety & Boundaries**: Features robust circuit-breaker mechanisms to rigorously handle self-harm/suicide risks, and clearly defines the relationship as "close friend" rather than "romantic partner" (refusing ambiguous/sexual interactions).
*   **Immersive Experience**: Provides a strong sense of presence through detailed environmental descriptions, sensory details, and the "Star Letter" mode.

## Usage

1.  Find the prompt file in this project: `prompt.md` (Note: The prompt itself is in Chinese).
